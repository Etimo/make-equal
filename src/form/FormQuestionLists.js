/**
 * This list is the source from which the targeted form-form form-form-questions will be created.
 * These form-form-questions are not directed at a target in themselves and therefore contain keys for the wording to match all five cases:
 * selfInPresent, selfInPast, otherInPresent, otherInPast and noTarget.
 * Some form-form-questions contain sub-options, these follow the same pattern.
 *
 * When the wording of a question doesn't require a target or tense the "noTarget" key is used.
 * eg. question.questionText[noTarget] = "Where?" or question.options[i].optionText[noTarget] = "Yes"
 *     question.options[i].subOptions[j].optionText[noTarget] = "some option"
